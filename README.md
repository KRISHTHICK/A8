a simple chatbot that extracts all information from an uploaded document using Python, you can follow these steps:

Set up a basic chatbot interface using a web framework like Flask.
Allow file uploads to the chatbot.
Extract information from the uploaded document using a library like PyPDF2 for PDFs, or docx for Word documents.
Process the extracted information and provide responses.
Here is an example implementation:

Step 1: Set up Flask
First, install Flask:

bash
pip install Flask
Step 2: Basic Flask Application
Create a file named app.py:

Python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'uploads'
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = UPLOAD_FOLDER

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return '''
    <h1>Upload a Document</h1>
    <form method="post" action="/upload" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="file" />
        <input type="submit" />
    </form>
    '''

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return 'No file part'
    file = request.files['file']
    if file.filename == '':
        return 'No selected file'
    if file:
        filename = file.filename
        filepath = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
        file.save(filepath)
        extracted_text = extract_information(filepath)
        return jsonify({'extracted_text': extracted_text})

def extract_information(filepath):
    # Placeholder for document extraction logic
    return "Extracted information from the document."

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Step 3: Handle Document Extraction
Add the logic to extract information from the document:

Python
import PyPDF2

def extract_information(filepath):
    text = ""
    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:
        reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(file)
        for page_num in range(reader.numPages):
            page = reader.getPage(page_num)
            text += page.extract_text()
    return text
Step 4: Run the Application
Ensure the uploads directory exists:

bash
mkdir uploads
Run the Flask application:

bash
python app.py
Summary
This creates a basic Flask web application that allows users to upload documents.
The uploaded document is saved to the uploads directory.
The document is processed to extract information, which is then returned as JSON.
You can customize the extract_information function to handle different document types and improve the extraction logic as needed.
